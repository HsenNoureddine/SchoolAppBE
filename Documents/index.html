            <div class="subTitle"> Arabic Specialists</div>
            <div class="subPara">
                Arabic is at the heart of our work at RadixLingua. We are totally cognizant of the value of this
                language. When using Arabic, we strive to ensure accuracy, avoiding what is weak, which has become so
                common that only experts can discriminate the accurate and pure from the erroneous and flawed.<br>
                <br>
                We translate from and into Arabic. When working from Arabic, we endeavor to produce a target text that
                reflects the gist of the original, faithfully indicating the intent of the author, but which holds, at
                the same time, the spirit of the language to which it is translated, abiding by its laws and respecting
                its rules.<br>
                When we translate into Arabic, our primary concern is to ensure that the Arabic translation is
                fathomable, and that it keeps up with the new terms, meanings and language usages that this language
                came to enclose - which have been thrust by exposure to others, but which do not blemish its principles
                or disrupt its morphology.<br>
                <br>
                The challenge we are taking on is considerable, as we seek to adhere to what is right and avoid
                imprecision. However, it is worthwhile all efforts and weariness, as the recompense is greater and more
                evident.<br>
                <br>
                Our willingness to seek precision prompts us to endeavor to produce a translation free of flaws in every
                language into which we translate. However, our focus on Arabic is excused because we are natives of this
                language and as the Arabic adage goes “the people of Mecca are more familiar with its alleys”.<br>
                Nonetheless, we seek to produce the best in every language listed. We thus put ourselves in the readers’
                shoes, reading all what we produce with the eye of the objective critique.

                In addition to texts of general content, our language services extend to encompass the following
                industries: the socio-political, the legal, the economic, the religious, the technical and the
                scientific, and we provide our language services for those fields in both directions between Arabic,
                English, French and Farsi, but also from Farsi into English.

            <div class="subPara">

                Radix Lingua is a comprehensive Language Services Agency committed to excellence. Our methodology has
                two
                pillars: Quality of Service guaranteed by a team of reliable experts, and a pliable approach which
                allows us
                to model our services around each and every client.

                our mission is to offer a specialized translation, by acting as the intermediary between our clients and
                their readers. We ultimately seek to bridge the gap between what is communicated and what is understood.

                we are based in Beirut, and we provide our services to local businesses, regional customers,
                international
                organisations, research centers and think tanks.
